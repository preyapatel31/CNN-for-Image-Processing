# CNN for Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. The project is ideal for beginners and intermediate practitioners looking to understand how to implement CNNs for computer vision problems.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and augmentation.
- Construction of a CNN model using popular deep learning frameworks.
- Model training and validation.
- Evaluation of model performance with metrics and visualizations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Other dependencies listed in the notebook

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-image-classification.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cnn-image-classification
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the `CNN for Image Classification.ipynb` file and execute the cells sequentially.

## Dataset

This notebook is designed to work with any image classification dataset. Ensure your dataset is properly organized into training and validation directories. The dataset structure should look like this:
```
|-- dataset
    |-- train
        |-- class_1
        |-- class_2
        |-- ...
    |-- validation
        |-- class_1
        |-- class_2
        |-- ...
```

You can modify the data loading section in the notebook to suit your dataset path.

## Results

The notebook includes visualizations of:
- Training and validation accuracy/loss.
- Sample predictions with corresponding confidence scores.

These outputs help in evaluating the performance of the CNN model.
